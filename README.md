# slide-block-solver
Python Solver for the sliding block puzzle of varying width x

Width defaults to 3 (i.e. 3x3 8 block sliding puzzle):

    1   2   3
    4   5   6
    7   8   0
  
When executing the example code, a different width can be passed in via the command line.
Executing "example 4" would result in the following puzzle board:
  
    1   2   3   4
    5   6   7   8
    9   10  11  12
    13  14  15  0
    
Each execution of the example code will produce an entirely new board by randomly shuffling the values.
